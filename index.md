# 👋 Hello! I'm Alisha Castillejos

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a web developer with a passion for building creative, interactive experiences.

## 🧰 My Toolbox

I'm comfortable working with:
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

Lately, I’ve been diving into **Phaser.js**, building browser-based games and learning how to blend code, storytelling, and a little bit of chaos into micro adventures.

## 🎮 Projects I’m Proud Of

### 🦸‍♀️ One Minute Hero *(WIP)*
A bite-sized adventure game where every second counts. It started as a playful experiment and has become my go-to sandbox for exploring game design, animation, and scene transitions in Phaser.

Check it out: (https://amcastillejos.github.io/one-min-hero/)

## 🌱 What I'm Learning

Right now, I’m focused on:
- Game loops and timing in Phaser.js
- Improving UX through subtle interactions
- Writing cleaner, modular JavaScript

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate

I love connecting with other developers, artists, and creative coders. Whether you want to chat about web games, jam on an idea, or just say hi — feel free to reach out!
