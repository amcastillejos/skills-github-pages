# 👋 Hi, I'm Alisha

I'm a 36-year-old mom on a mission to break into tech — one late-night coding session at a time.

---

## 💡 My Why

By day, I work a full-time job and take care of my family. By night, I turn on my laptop, open up FreeCodeCamp or Codecademy, and build — websites, games, and a new future for myself.

I don’t come from a traditional tech background, but I’ve always been curious about how things work. Learning to code has shown me that creativity and problem-solving are skills I’ve been using all along — now I’m just adding some JavaScript to the mix.

---

## 📚 What I'm Learning

I’ve been building a strong foundation with:
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

Currently diving into:
- **Phaser.js** – exploring how to make browser-based games!

I’m focused on building real projects and learning by doing, especially things that are interactive and a little playful.

## 🕹️ Projects in Progress

### 🎮 One Minute Hero *(WIP)*
A fast-paced micro adventure built in Phaser.js — designed to be played in under 60 seconds. Think of it as a creative way to combine my love of storytelling with my new coding skills.

## 💪 What Keeps Me Going

Breaking into tech as an adult — and a parent — is tough. But so is parenting, and I do that every day. I’ve learned to be patient with myself, to celebrate small wins, and to keep going even when things feel overwhelming.

If you're out there learning late at night too, you're not alone. We've got this.

## 🤝 Let’s Connect

I’d love to meet other:
- Career changers
- Women in tech
- Beginner game developers
- Kind humans building cool things

Feel free to reach out, collaborate, or just say hi!
